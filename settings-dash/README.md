# Settings Dashboard

### ✨ [View live](https://settings-dash.behonbaker.com) ✨

Another item added to the One Day collection. This time, a settings dashboard. I saw a design on dribble and decided to make my own version of it with the set of components I made for nuxt.

- [UI Thing](https://ui-thing.behonbaker.com/getting-started/introduction) - My library
- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Radix-Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/)
- [Nuxt i18n](https://v8.i18n.nuxtjs.org/)
