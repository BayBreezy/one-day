# One Day

This repo/monorepo.. whatever its called, is just a set of projects that I am testing out in a single day. The rule is to not allow a day to pass on any given app. If it goes over a day, we can leave it as is. We can always come back to it in the future

I use these things when making apps

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)
- [Strapi](https://strapi.io/)
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [UI Thing](https://ui-thing.behonbaker.com/getting-started/introduction) - My own component library
- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)

## Projects

Completed projects so far

- [Settings Dashboard](./settings-dash/README.md)

  - This is a Settings dashboard UI inspired by a design I saw on dribble. I decided to make my own version of it with the set of components I made for nuxt.
